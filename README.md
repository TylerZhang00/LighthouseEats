# Rumours - Restaurant & Lounge

A restaurant application that allows the customer to select items from a menu and place an order. Upon placing an order, the restaurant will receive an order confirmation text while the customer will receive a confirmation call.

An order summary will then display on the app and a map will render showing the directions from the customer's address to Rumours.
